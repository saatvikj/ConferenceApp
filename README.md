# Conference Portal

Conference Portal is a web-based service to generate a customized android application for your conference. It consists of two components - <b>django-based web application</b> and a <b>generic android application</b>. The organizers register their conference, along with the required details on the web service, which then generates a specific APK file for that particular conference. The final application will support two modes - offline and online.
