Creating Your Own Path in ICTD,"As a young researcher, finding productive, reliable mentorship and role models in both personal and professional contexts can be influential, yet challenging. This session offers opportunities for younger researchers to get career guidance and mentorship from a diverse set of experienced members of the ICTD community. The focus of the session will be to expose young researchers to potential career paths and ways of exhibiting leadership in their local community, as well as to support students in making decisions about their futures.","Naveena Karusala (University of Washington),Esther Jang (University of Washington)",SR1
Child Trafficking in India: How can Technology Help?,The session will present an overview of child trafficking in India through an organisation that is actively working in this domain. We will also present a demo of an existing AI-based technology that is being used to tackle some of the existing issues. This will be followed by an analysis of how this technology is being expanded to predict generic mental health problems such as depression. The session will conclude with an open discussion that will foster partnership between industries and other organisations and discuss how the existing technology can be expanded and utilized for different use cases.,"Shubham Atreja (IBM Research India),Anupama Ray (IBM Research India),Prerna Agarwal (IBM Research India),Darcy Pierce (EmancipAction),Priyanka Halli (EmancipAction)",SR2
"Open Government Data and Accountability: Hype, Reality or a Possibility?","Open Government Data (OGD) refers to making government data publicly available through online portals to enhance transparency of the State towards citizens. Many national and regional governments are adopting OGD world over. Yet, we don’t fully understand how the availability of such datasets influences the existing mechanisms of citizen-State engagement. Does it make the citizens negotiate more effectively with the State? Does it make the State more accountable to citizens? Or does it only “empower the empowered” while leaving out the more disempowered? In this session, we seek to understand the practitioners’ perspective on the impact of OGD.","Rajesh Hanbal (IIIT Bangalore),Sham Kashyap (Azim Premji University)",SR7
ICTD Ethics Clinic,"The aim of the session is to create a supportive peer-to-peer learning environment where researchers can get guidance on how to translate the newly announced minimum ethical standards for ICTD/ICT4D research into their professional practice. These standards were developed in a participatory, interdisciplinary, multi-year process with members of the ICTD conference community and others (see https://ictdethics.wordpress.com/). Peer mentors will be offering short confidential conversations to discuss particular ethical challenges. The session will allow the standards to embed as a continuous, participatory learning process.","Dorothea Kleine (University of Sheffield),Andy Dearden (Sheffield Hallam University)",SR9
