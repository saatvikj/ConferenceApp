Keynote: Michael Mazgaonkar,"MICHAEL MAZGAONKAR was born and brought up in Mumbai and the Paunar ashram (founded by Vinoba Bhave, a colleague and spiritual heir of Gandhi). Early on, he left Mumbai to study engineering, and also participated in Gandhian youth camps to learn about issues such as the inequities between rural and urban India and how trained professionals tend to leave rural areas, concentrating skills in urban areas. He, along with his wife, decided to use their skills in rural communities. They travelled across India, meeting activists on issues in rural areas, and decided to live and work in an Adivasi community.

Mazgaonkar has been learning about community-driven development and activism for the past 30 years while living in Mozda village in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat. He is a founding member of the Mozda Collective, a team of individuals dedicated to holistic rural development, and Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti, an environmental advocacy group that challenges conventional growth-based development models. He uses his engineering expertise to train communities to use technology to improve living conditions and livelihoods through activities like watershed development, harvesting alternative energy, and supporting a local agricultural cooperative. His group has been making LED based solar lights since 2004 and installed a 1 kW wind electric turbine in 2005 to supply lighting to over 10 homes. His group has also made and used parabolic solar cookers since 2006. Since 2012, he has succeeded in going off the electricity grid, also using open-source solutions to overcome a lack of landline or mobile network coverage. Demystification of technologies and employing locally-appropriate solutions is the group's focus. Mazgaonkar is also committed to struggles against the corporate-centered development paradigm that has been disempowering families across Gujarat, particularly in relation to forest rights, industrial pollution, and governance.",Michael Mazgaonkar
