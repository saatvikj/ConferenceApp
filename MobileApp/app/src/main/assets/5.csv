Post-use ICTs and their Disposal,"This open session will discuss the politics of ICT disposal. This is an aspect of ICT deployment and use which is often overlooked but is nonetheless extremely important, as improper disposal of ICTs can have a damaging effect on human health and the environment. In this session, members from NGOs, government and legal organizations, as well as academics will come together to discuss how to resolve the e-waste problem as well as discuss who gets left out of conversations about e-waste disposal and how they can be included in the discussion.",Anisha Nazareth (Independent),CR2
Designing Culturally Aware and Resource Appropriate Digital Mental Health Interventions,"In the Global South, the burden of mental health disorders is unique, with increased stigma, fewer resources, and 80 percent of those with a mental health disorder living in the Global South. Considering the impact of identity-based attributes on mental illness and technology usage, we convene a diverse group of mental health professionals, ICTD researchers, and HCI researchers to discuss best practices and research priorities when doing digital mental health research in the Global South.","Sachin Pendse (MSR India),Mamta Sood (AIIMS Delhi),Seema Mehrotra (NIMHANS Bengaluru),Amit Sharma (MSR India)",SR1
Sustainable Business Models for Last-Mile Connectivity,"The open session on Sustainable Business Models for Last Mile Connectivity will look into innovative business models that enable both connectivity as well as sustains the connectivity after it has been enabled to the unconnected. Grassroots Internet access initiatives are exploring ways of driving down the costs of deploying and operating network infrastructure through the use of innovative technologies and business models. These deployments have adopted different ways of financing and raising revenue - some of these initiatives provide Internet access at community anchor institutions, and offer a range of complementary products in addition to Internet connectivity. Are these initiatives sustainable financially and otherwise?  What are their drivers of sustainability? How do community-centered principles of governance interact with business principles of profitability?","Sarbani Banerjee Belur (Gram Marg, IIT Bombay),Sharada Srinivasan (University of Pennsylvania),Ritu Srivastava (Digital Empowerment Foundation)",SR2
Listening from the Archives,"This session explores the use of historical and participatory art methods in ICTD research. Seasoned practitioners, please join us to share your experiences and primary documents. We also welcome researchers new to these methods who hope to learn from the experiences and archival selections of other researchers. As a starting point, we will listen to archival selections from the National Radio Cambodia, including music from 1960s and a lakon ajai (spoken comedy, with translation) from 1984. Before and after the listening portions, we will explore through discussion the ways that contemporary ICT use builds off of older forms of culturally-specific media practices, particularly in postcolonial and post-conflict settings. We hope that the listening portion (which includes rare Khmer traditional music samples) will be an enjoyable and relaxing way to spend conference time. This program was originally developed in collaboration with Lyno Vuth and the Sa Sa Art Project team in Phnom Penh.",Margaret Jack (Cornell University),SR9
