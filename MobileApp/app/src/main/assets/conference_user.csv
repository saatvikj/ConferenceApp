Ajeet Singh,ajeet.singh@crs.org,Catholic Relief Services,,"We are using ICT application for advocating farmers on site specific crop management advice. This tool has been developed by IRRI and it's research partners in Bihar and has been endorsed SAUs for use of farmers in Bihar. We are trying to enhance access of this application to farmers in stress prone rice-based rainfed areas of Bihar working through private sector engagement (Private Service Provider (PSP) model of extension). Using this model of extension we have faced some operational challenges and reached to create some successful cases. We want to present our experience to the participants in the conference and get their response and feedback.
We are using ICT during emergency responses in different states of India for beneficiaries registration, triangulation of information, tracking of progress, etc. This initiatives have been greatly appreciated by district administrations and state government for maintaining the huge data base, minimizing errors, maintaining transparency, ease of reporting, etc. We would also like to share our experience of using ICT4E during Kerala flood response in 2018 and Bihar Flood response last year.",,,Attendee

It was an extraordinary experience to go beneath the hagiography of mobile phones that has captured the Indian public consciousness and mainstream discourse, and to see in full first-hand view the engagement of the subaltern with ICTs. Clearly, a large populace has been left out of effective utilisation of ICTs due to their historical social condition, which has been the case with the greater development story as such. We need to address this issue in India, and apply these learnings to understanding other subaltern communities and their ICTD experiences elsewhere in the world.",,,Attendee

By looking at the problems in greater depth I have encountered various issues which can be solved using Modern day Technology.  I have the experience to tackle the problem of making people wash their hand for a minimum stipulated amount of time. We tackled this problem using microprocessor and sensor architecture. The other research was more intensive than the former one and it is my topic of my Demo at ICTD X. It involves making a machine understand the structure of a news article which can then be used for statistics collection. We believe that the statistic we want to collect will be crucial for Road safety organisations and instrumental in saving lives.",,,Attendee
Anisha Nazareth,anishanazareth1211@gmail.com,Independent Researcher,,"I recently graduated from IIIT Bangalore where I completed my Masters degree in Information Technology. I am interested in research in ICTD and STS in general. During my Masters I studied how the sociomaterial nature of e-waste affects consumer decisions w.r.t e-waste disposal in South Bangalore. During my research among formal sector e-waste recyclers in Bangalore, I found that both the nature of the technological artefact (what components it has, how diﬃcult it is to mend) and the local consumption patterns played a big role in whether they chose to refurbish or recycle a component. For instance mobile phones are rarely refurbished but computers are because computers have a much longer life cycle than mobile phones and thus could be resold. I would love to continue working on how various sociomaterial dimensions of technology shape peoples perceptions and how this can be used to design speciﬁc technological solutions for social issues in developing economies.",,,Attendee

My venture into ICTD started when I started working with Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth at IITD for my master's thesis. Broadly we are working on using nightlight satellite data and images to predict social development indicators. Before that I had worked with Rahul Panicker, at the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence, where we worked on developing a pipeline for estimating volume from only images. The core application of this was for estimating the weight of new-born babies using only images for detecting whether they are low-birth-weight or not. I have also worked with Prof. Mausam at IITD for my undergraduate thesis, where we amassed an unprecedented dataset of court cases from Indian district courts. Our analysis focused on 2 broad verticals - detecting anomalously performing courts across various metrics, and using machine learning to develop models which predict the case duration time given case information.

Nihaalini Kumar,nihaalini@gmail.com,Terre des Hommes Foundation,,"As part of a team at Terre des Hommes Foundation (Tdh), I have helped conduct a detailed analysis of the use of ICT in the social sectors in South Asia, as relevant to Tdh’s programmes of focus, which include migration, labour exploitation, mother and child health, juvenile justice, and humanitarian crises. The paper we present is an outcome of this study, with a focus on the use of ICT for child protection. While health and education lead in the use of ICT, its use in child protection is sparse and ill-understood. Through this research, we hope to close the knowledge gap on how ICT is used for child protection by presenting the global and South Asia-specific landscapes, focusing on notable initiatives, partnerships and tools. We also hope to guide future use by putting forth a concept for an ICT-strengthened, child-centred system for case identification and management. The concept can be implemented using existing solutions of proven utility and efficacy. Therefore, we show that ICTs have a very high potential for use in child protection and can build on an increasingly solid evidence base and some important successes.  ",,,Attendee

Benjamin Akinmoyeje,benakin@gmail.com,National Open University of Nigeria,,"Our session is aimed at producing some insights about the impact of EU GDPR on ICTD projects.Our open session aims to have EU GDPR as the main topic for the scope is about how this measures is affecting the overall ICTD community in general in terms of data protection, storage, analysis, and how other community members and society in general feel about this.Yes it is possible to expand the scope as we had anticipated that the subsequent conversation will address the suggested questions. Specifically we want to address the changes the EU GDPR has inspired in the developing regions; prior to the emergence of the EU GDPR, privacy laws barely existed; but now there are multiple laws across different countries, E.g. Tanzania just introduced Personal Data law where the entire country data belongs to the government.
We will also recommend the best practice of responsible data use and privacy of ICTD research and projects.
It will take on two segments; the first part will discuss the role of data collection in the success of ICTD research and project; the norms around most ICTD projects and data privacy in the past decade.
Secondly we will consider what has changed with the new laws and what have to be tweaked in the future research and implementation.
Participants will be provided workbook to jot their reviews of these scenarios and some will be called up to share their perspectives.

Chris Muashekele,pmuashekele@gmail.com,Namibia University of Science and Technology,,"I am a Master's student at the Namibia University of Science and Technology. My main area of interest is development of rural/indigenous communities. This development occurs through co-design of technology with the communities, who are viewed to be on an equal footing as the researchers. Co-designing with communities is extremely important because it allows communities to put forward their ideas as technology users. The communities have a lot of knowledge and through co-design, researchers can tap into that knowledge and develop solutions that can have a lasting impact. I have been privileged to be part of several ICTD projects. One of which is the SCIONA project, which aims for the co-design of conservation management technology with indigenous communities. The technology designed aims to enhance their livelihoods. In addition, the technology will also strengthen conservation management. Another major area of interest for me is how technology impacts culture and traditions within the rural areas. I seek to understand how the implementation of technology impacts the culture and traditions of the users, in this case rural/indigenous communities. ",,,Attendee

Soumyo Das,soumyo.das@iiitb.org,IIIT Bangalore,,"We started our work on studying the impact of technology intervention in social welfare benefit programs in Karnataka. Our primary aim was to study the different forms of data injustice which takes place at the grassroot level in the Public Distribution System in the state due to the mandatory utilisation of bio-metric verification for benefit distribution. In the first phase, fieldwork was conducted in rural and semi-urban areas around Bangalore, from where we gained critical insights about the workings of the new targeted system. After detailed on-field observation of beneficiaries and other actors, many of our assumptions about how the system works were debunked. While the technology intervention certainly has brought forward many benefits (as echoed by a large number of the respondents), it has also created multiple barriers for certain categories of beneficiaries. Our work focuses on the study and analysis of such barriers, which were perhaps hitherto not thought of during the technology design process, but which have major negative implications for entitled beneficiaries.",,,Attendee
Ashwed Patil,ashpatil@iu.edu,Indiana University Bloomington,,"I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in Information Science from Indiana University Bloomington with a keen interest in ICTD.  have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Pune, India. During my undergrad, I worked for a non-profit for close to two years teaching underprivileged kids in orphanages and shelter homes. My background in computer science and experience with the non-profit have immensely influenced my career interests in using technology to solve challenges that poor people face. I am particularly interested in using data analytics and big data in international development policy related issues. This can include numerous sectors such as global development indicators, survey analytics, conflict prevention, human rights, education, health and financial inclusion. Additionally, I also have secondary interests in social aspects of technology when used in the development context and ethics in using ICTD. Some of the research questions I am interested in looking into are:
 - The use of technology in refugee settings – I believe that refugees are being left behind in the global tech revolution when they are the ones who actually need it the most. I believe that refugee crisis must be seen as a development issue than just a humanitarian one. Some of the research questions in this area could be using technology for financial inclusion (mobile banking, entrepreneurship), how technology could be used in refugee children and youth education, the use of technology in preserving culture during conflicts and migration, leveraging big data for refugees
  - The use of big data and analytics in achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals 
 - Assessment of India’s eGovernment Program – Digital India launched in 2015
I hope that the program committee allows me to attend the Young Researchers in ICTD Reception to not only expose me to larger ICTD research topics but also give me a chance to connect with experts in the field to help fulfill my aspirations.

Mehri Shahzeidi,mehrishahzeidi@gmail.com,University of Alzahra,,"Based on Iran’s Department of Environment’s reports on 2017, Isfahan is one the most polluted cities in Iran that suffers from frequent environmental problems. These problems resulted in eliminating of urban wildlife and plant species. However, Esfahan’s citizens play a passive role in dealing with urban problems in general and environmental problems in particular. 
In spite of this passivity, currently available evidence demonstrates that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be effective significantly in terms of environment. Camper to all kind of technologies, ICT substantially could mobilize people environmental participation, because it can provide them with wide range information on environment. Moreover, ICT offers new forms of communication that potentially enable people to discuss about various aspects of environmental problems. To explain more clearly, ICT can help to problematize the current situation of environment and make people to accept it as a problem. However, environmental participation would not be restricted to online space. This research try to benefit from both online and offline space to improving environment condition.

My research captures these marketplaces in flux as communities respond to the entry of new digital services and formal alternatives to traditional ways of shopping. Historically, offline marketplaces have been important public spaces and at the center of urban growth in the Global South (and many parts of the Global North). They also represent bottom-up approaches towards the distribution of goods and services that are embedded in local contexts. For a section of the population, these are “consumption junctions” for technology goods – i.e. spaces where individuals are introduced to technologies, interact with them, and make purchase decisions. Further, they are the primary sites where these technology goods are also maintained and repaired. As collective socio-economic entities that bring sellers, consumers, and goods together into a single physical space, they are rich sites for the study of technology consumption.

I researched on how to spread information virally to people with financial incentives. This was an eye opening experience for me, primarily because I never worked with the set of user group (remote, rural and poor). The idea behind the project was we would invite people to participate in a short audio tutorial about any topic (it was about forest rights in our case)  and after hearing the tutorial, they would take a small quiz. If they passed they get an instant direct cash transfer to mobile phone. We found that it was our approach was so attractive in the low-income communities that we could get people's attention about important issues very fast and spread it to other people. Our system became instantly popular and we spread to around 15000 users in span of 3 weeks. Many people were passion through quiz and learning how to use forest rights.

So definitely building systems that use incentives or innovative ways to change behaviors are very interesting to me.

As part of one of the projects, we conducted a study with a group of Indian citizens and civic authorities to understand the usability of different modalities -- image, text, audio and video -- for reporting of civic issues in a developing country (India). We found that images were the most preferred, yet authorities only relied upon text to receive civic complaints due to the lack of adequate technological infrastructure. To bridge this gap, we developed a system for generating text based descriptions from input images to precisely describe the underlying civic issue. 

My gaol is to bring about a change in the status of education in my country - India. One of the major problems here is that of student dropout, which has not been very well studied in the Indian context. There are multiple socio-economic and cultural factors that are responsible for the same, which I wish to study and eventually introduce some steps to reduce student dropout in India.",,,Attendee
