Keynote: Murali Shanmugavelan,"MURALI SHANMUGAVELAN has 20 years of experience working on research, policy, and development projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia that seek to leverage media such as the internet and mobile phones to address social problems. He has worked with government actors in these regions, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock in Afghanistan and the Access to Information project in Bangladesh. In reaction to the time-bound nature of ICT and development projects, Shanmugavelan began his PhD at the University of Londonâ€™s School of Oriental and African Studies, using ethnographic methods to study the communicative practices of a Dalit caste group in Tamil Nadu, known as Arunthathiyars. His thesis explores how the hierarchical nature of caste communication networks shapes and is shaped by modern digital networks. Shanmugavelan is also the director of Maple Consulting Services, a consulting firm that works with governments, NGOs, and private institutions in the United Kingdom and internationally to address social and economic challenges through media-related policies and practices.",Murali Shanmugavelan,
