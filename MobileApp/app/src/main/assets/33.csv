Is This Time Different? The Novelty of ICT in ICTD,"The past few decades have born unprecedented technological progress, ushering in an age where new technologies emerge and are adopted at a dizzying pace. In the midst of this, ICTD hopes to understand or capture the potential of these technologies for social, political, and economic change. At times it feels as though we have witnessed a complete transformation into a future that would have been hardly recognizable 5 or 10 years prior. But sometimes it seems that the world stubbornly refuses to change, despite our best efforts. We end up relearning old lessons and repeating the same mistakes. While we have new tools at our disposal, many of the problems we want to tackle remain the same. So which is it? Is this truly a revolutionary period, or is it just hyped up window dressing? And in particular, within our ICTD community, do we find ourselves to be too techno-optimist, or too techno-skeptic? The answer lies between the two extremes, but how do we find the right path ahead, to harness effectively the potential that does exist?","Brandon Liu (Everwell Health Solutions),William Thies (MSR India)"
