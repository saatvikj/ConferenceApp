ICTD and Personal Informatics,"The Personal Informatics (PI) community has explored using smartphones and wearables to better understand various facets of an individual, such as their health and well-being. ICTD has conducted PI-type research (e.g., maternal health tracking), but it has a different philosophical approach towards it. Even though smartphone adoption is increasing in the developing regions, not much work has examined the adoption of such platforms or their requirements. In this panel, we seek to explore how why this is the case, and potential opportunities and challenges in bringing the two communities together towards a shared goal.",Ravi Karkar (University of Washington)
Machine Learning for India-Specific Problems,"Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In recent years, there has been a widespread interest in ML. ML has been applied across diverse domains like agriculture, automotive, customer service, travel, healthcare, banking and financial services, education etc. This session will focus on India-specific problems that can be addressed by ML. It will be conducted in a workshop style and will have talks and a panel discussion.","Ashish Tendulkar (Google Inc.),Divy Thakkar (Google Inc.),Pankaj Gupta (Google Inc.),Varun Gulshan (Google Inc.)"
"Social Media, Politics, and the Process of Engagement in the Indian Context","Increasingly, political movements in the Global South have been taking place online, and fundamentally understanding this process is essential to the study of democracy. In this session, we will map the intersection of political and social engagement with technology in the Indian context, focusing on the influence of social media. We will be approaching this space from different angles, including qualitative research with campaign organizers, as well as quantitative analysis of political social media.","Divya Siddarth (MSR India),Anmol Panda (MSR),Ram Chandrasekharan (MSR),Drupa Charles (MSR),Shubi Agarwal (MSR),Azhagu Meena (Tata Trusts),Srujana Kamath (MSR)"
Do Digital Identity Systems Have a Theory of Inclusion?,"Designing a national scale unitary digital ID system in democratic regimes can be better understood as a wicked problem which are well served by adopting systems-thinking approaches that explicitly engage with the inherent complexity rather than rationalizing them away. In this session, we engage with diverse perspectives on complexity drawn from the disciplines of computer science, law, and public policy to engage with questions concerning inclusion in digital ID designs and infrastructure.",Bidisha Chaudhuri (IIIT Bangalore)
