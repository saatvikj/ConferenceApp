Gary Marsden Memorial Session: Whither ICTD,"Is it time for ICTD 3.0? What is working, and what needs change in our disciplines, conferences, and departments? In other words: Whither ICTD? This open session will dive into some of the major points of change and challenge within ICTD, will weigh alternatives, and will try to chart some directions forward. It will be organized as a highly interactive panel dealing with three primary areas of change and opportunity: geography, disciplines, and themes.","Fran√ßois Bar (University of Southern California),Michael Best (Georgia Tech),Chris Coward (University of Washington),Nicki Dell (Cornell Tech),Richard Heeks (University of Manchester),Dorothea Kleine (University of Sheffield),Kentaro Toyama (University of Michigan)",SR1
Gender Equality in the Indian IT Workplace,We want this panel discussion to start a dialogue amongst practitioners and policy makers about the experiences of being a woman in the Indian IT workplace. We are hoping this will bring out the hidden nuances of these experiences and give these women a suitable platform to share and even discuss them.,"Oindrila Matilal (IIIT Bangalore),Mounika Neerukonda (IIIT Bangalore)",SR2
Intersectional Computing for Technology and Development,"In this open session, we'll split our agenda in two, with the first half entailing a storytelling open mic format, asking people to share their encounters with intersectionality in their ICTD practice (or life, really). The second half will focus on collectively putting together a list of resources that offer diverse takes on intersectionality, as they are relevant for ICTD theory and praxis, discussing challenges and opportunities for extending this scholarship within ICTD. Throughout, we'll consider the role that theory plays, and might play, in ICTD.","Neha Kumar (Georgia Tech),Naveena Karusala (University of Washington),Marisol Wong-Villacres (Georgia Tech),Michaelanne Dye (Georgia Tech),Josiah Mangiameli (Georgia Tech),Karthik Bhat (Georgia Tech),Anupriya Tuli (IIIT Delhi)",SR7
Impact of EU GDPR and Other Data Protection on ICTD Projects: How it Will Affect the Concepts of Open Data and Big Data for Social Innovation,"This is a panel session that will bring together ICTD, data protection, and open data researchers to discuss the impact of EU GDPR on ICTD projects or data collection procedures. Also discussion will look at how the different privacy and data protection laws are going to impact data collection for decision-making in developing countries. This session will provide avenues for students and researchers who did not submit or have their papers accepted and are working in the area of data science and development to have an open conversation. How is data privacy affecting social innovation and the realities of ICTD in different countries? We anticipate participation from the community to discuss how EU GDPR and other data protections impact    ICTD projects and how they will inhibit the concepts of open data and big data for social innovation.",Benjamin Akinmoyeje (Management Sciences for Health),SR9
