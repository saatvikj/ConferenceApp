Narratives in ICTD Research: A Workshop on Theory and Praxis of the Most Significant Change Technique,"Impact evaluation forms one of the perennial and core areas of research within the ICTD community which entails the use of a diverse range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies—separately or as mixed methods. In this open session, we propose to stress on the importance of narratives within the ICTD research and in so doing, familiarize the session participants with the theory and praxis of the Most Significant Change Technique.","Aparna Moitra (University of Delhi),Pooja Ichplani (Johns Hopkins University),Archna Kumar (University of Delhi)",CR2
Beyond IVR: Voice-User Interfaces for Emerging Smartphone Users,"With the steady growth of smartphone users and increasing number of mobile Internet users, new types of voice user interfaces—such as voice-based search and voice assistants—are becoming an integral part for smartphone users’ everyday lives. Following the long-term interest of the ICTD community in user interfaces for users in developing contexts, we aim to host an unconference to bring together like-minded individuals to develop a research agenda for these interfaces among underserved communities.","Apoorva Bhalla (IIIT Bangalore),Bidisha Chaudhuri (IIIT Bangalore),Linus Kendall (Sheffield Hallam University and IIIT Bangalore)",SR2
Design Workshop: Google’s Next Billion Product Design Framework,"Hundreds of millions of people are coming online in countries like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. The technical contexts, social settings, and cultural nuances of the countries are critical to consider in the act of designing new technologies. At Google, we’ve taken the insights from our field research and developed a framework for designing and building technology aimed at emerging markets. The framework offers three main pillars of experience: Usable, Useful and Engaging, each with three essential sub-themes. We find these nine essential points are crucial when creating apps, services, and devices tailored to the lives and local infrastructure of the next billion users. In this workshop, we aim to share this framework, methodology of implementation, and facilitate discussion between attendees about how the framework applies to technology in their own work and lives. This workshop is aimed at researchers, designers, product thinkers who are thinking deeply about building new products for the next billion users, and/or intend to extend their product offering to these users.","Muzayun Mukhtar (Google),Garen Checkley (Google),Prachi Nagpal (Google),Aysha Siddique (Google),Divy Thakkar (Google),Mrinal Sharma (Google)",SR1
The Fairwork Foundation: Strategies for Fairer Platform Work,"This open session will address the rise of platform work. It will introduce the Fairwork Foundation—a project designed to use academic research to find ways to support platforms workers and improve conditions. The aim of the session is to explore and understand what “fair work”—mediated on online platforms—means in an Indian context. Participants will discuss the challenges and opportunities, reflecting on how these can be met in practice.","Mark Graham (University of Oxford),Jamie Woodcock (University of Oxford),Richard Heeks (University of Manchester),Jean-Paul VanBelle (University of Cape Town)",SR9
Re-Imagining Primary Healthcare in the Age of AI,"The Government of India envisions upgrading existing primary healthcare facilities to Health & Wellness Centres that will double the scope of services and care areas without the presence of any medical doctors. In this scenario, how can AI and related technologies empower mid-level health workers to deliver high-quality primary healthcare services to rural, last-mile populations in India? In this interactive workshop, attendees will work with public health experts, decision makers, and AI researchers to brainstorm and design an AI-enabled Health & Wellness Centre, and hence, the primary healthcare model of the future.","Amrita Mahale (Wadhwani AI),Nikhil Jagtiani (Wadhwani AI),Rahul Panicker (Wadhwani AI),Raghu Dharmaraju (Wadhwani AI),Decision makers and practitioners from the WISH Foundation",CR12
