Keynote: Smitha Radhakrishnan,"SMITHA RADHAKRISHNAN is the Luella LaMer Associate Professor of Women's Studies and an Associate Professor of Sociology at Wellesley College. Her scholarship has used ethnographic methods to examine the institutional contexts of work, finance, and international development, in the geographical contexts of urban India, the U.S., and South Africa. Her first book Appropriately Indian: Gender and Culture in a Transnational Class was a multi-sited ethnographic examination of transnational Indian information technology workers. Currently, Radhakrishnan is working on a book manuscript that examines for-profit microfinance in India.  Through interviews and ethnographic work in India and the United States, this project investigates how global finance continues to expand its reach to new populations through small, uncollateralized loans that target women. At Wellesley, she teaches courses that examine globalization, race, gender, diaspora studies, and other topics.",Smitha Radhakrishnan,
